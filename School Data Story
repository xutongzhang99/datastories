The Public Schools Data is more than just a list of boring schools it is a place that we have designated be safe for children and allow the kids of our future to have a good education. To ensure all students have an opportunity to live wihout fear, we need to be serious about planning safety. By analyzing this data, we noticed a trend: schools in busy or less wealthy areas see more traffic and more traffic accidents. This pattern helped us pinpoint schools that are at greater risk of traffic accidents because of where they are. With this information, we can focus on making these schools safer right away. We can improve things like crosswalks, signs, and traffic lights to make the area safer for students and people walking by.
