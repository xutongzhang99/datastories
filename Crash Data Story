The Crash Reporting Data can be very scary to look at. Each plot is a place where someone lost something, whether it be money, friends, or even their own lives. But it also helps us stop future accidents. By looking closely at the data, we found some roads and crossroads near schools that are very dangerous because there are a lot of crashes there. This information is very important for taking steps to prevent more accidents. For instance, the data showed that the crossroad near Cannon Road Elementary School had a lot of accidents. This led to putting in place things to slow down traffic and making sure traffic rules are followed more strictly during school hours.
